# Iris_flower_classification using Multiple Machine Learning model
  This is a portfolio project that is basically for classification of Iris_Flowerfrom UCI Machine learning https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris 
data set using machine learning learning with python to predict the species of a new sample of Iris flower.

## Introduction

We are going to use the iris flowers dataset. A we'll be performing classification using (LogisticRegression,LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
KNeighborsClassifier,DecisionTreeClassifier) algorithm.
The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species.

  * The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
  * Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):
      * 1. Length of the sepals
      * 2. Width of the sepals
      * 3. Length of the petals
      * 4. Width of the petals

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes heavy use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization Libraries

## What this project covers?

  * Loading Data
  * Summarization 
  * Visualization
  * Model bulding and Validation
## Software and Libraries
  * Python
  * Pandas
  * Scikit-Learn
    * It is better to use Anaconda distribution to get all the package pre-installed
##  Code working 
* There are two file available for all the coding part  :
  * Jupyternotebook file in (.ipynb) results are displayed within notebook .
  * Python script in(.py) for result you have to run this file on any python IDE(prefer:Spyder)
    * Note : Jupyternotebook file is well documented .
